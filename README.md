## Features

### Core Functionality (Must-Haves)

- **Pet Profiles:** Create and manage one or more pet profiles (name, breed, age, weight, date of birth, etc.), saved with SQLite.
- **Daily Log Entries:** Record daily wellbeing data such as mood, energy level, appetite, symptoms, notes, and custom tags.
- **Log Storage & Retrieval:** All logs are stored in SQLite and retrieved per pet profile; prevents duplicate entries for the same day.
- **View Past Logs:** Review logs in a table or list format with sorting and filtering by date, mood, or energy level.
- **CSV Export:** Export selected logs to a CSV file with headers, formatted for easy sharing with a veterinarian.
- **Pattern & Trend Analyzer:** Detect recurring issues (e.g., low energy 3+ days, loss of appetite, repeated symptoms) and highlight potential health risks or conditions. Provides non-diagnostic suggestions to help owners decide if a vet visit may be needed.
- **Basic JavaFX UI:** Simple, clean interface for pet profiles, logging, log viewing, exporting, and navigation. Includes optional light/dark theme toggle.
- **Data Visualizations:** Charts for mood and energy trends over time.
  
### Bonus Features (Nice-to-Haves)

- **Multi-Day Summary:** Weekly/monthly summaries showing averages and common tags.
- **Advanced Search & Filters:** Filter logs by keyword, date range, or symptom.
- **Reminders & Notifications:** Alerts for missed entries or daily reminders.
- **Data Backup & Restore:** Export/import the full database for backups.

### Stretch Goals

- **Login System (Local):** Optional secure login with hashed passwords.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Resource bundles to support multiple languages.
- **Expanded Pet Support:** Extend beyond dogs to include cats and other species.
