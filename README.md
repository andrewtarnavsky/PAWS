üêæ PAWS - Pet Activity & Wellness System

A Java-based desktop application that allows pet owners to log, monitor, and analyze their pet‚Äôs daily wellbeing. PAWS helps identify trends in a pet‚Äôs health, highlight potential issues early, and maintain detailed records over time ‚Äî all stored locally on the user‚Äôs machine.

‚ú® Features
Core Functionality (Must-Haves)

Pet Profiles: Create and manage one or more pet profiles (name, breed, age, weight, date of birth, etc.), saved with SQLite.

Daily Log Entries: Record daily wellbeing data such as mood, energy level, appetite, symptoms, notes, and custom tags.

Log Storage & Retrieval: All logs are stored in SQLite and retrieved per pet profile; prevents duplicate entries for the same day.

View Past Logs: Review logs in a table or list format with sorting and filtering by date, mood, or energy level.

CSV Export: Export selected logs to a CSV file with headers, formatted for easy sharing with a veterinarian.

Pattern & Trend Analyzer: Detect recurring issues (e.g., low energy 3+ days, loss of appetite, repeated symptoms) and highlight potential health risks or conditions. Provides non-diagnostic suggestions to help owners decide if a vet visit may be needed.

Basic JavaFX UI: Simple, clean interface for pet profiles, logging, log viewing, exporting, and navigation. Includes optional light/dark theme toggle.

Nice-to-Haves (Future Additions)

Data Visualizations: Charts for mood and energy trends over time.

Multi-Day Summary: Weekly/monthly summaries showing averages and common tags.
